# produce-calendar
A seasonal produce calendar for determining when various fruits and vegetables are in season and fresh or are available from local stockpiles. 

I chose to begin this project to better teach myself CSS Grid. I may also incorporate JavaScript to populate the calendar with new produce items.

In the future, I may fork this repo and modify its purpose for a landscape plant database.
